        "description": "In the evolution of inspection programs, the fixed interval inspection strategy has been replaced by a condition-based monitoring approach. Condition-based monitoring is followed by risk-based inspection (RBI), where inspection programs are defined on a risk basis, considering damage mechanisms, failure probability and associated consequences. The use of new inspection technologies such as PAUT, TOFD, Remote Operated Vehicles (ROV) and Intelligent Pigging Inspection, etc. was able to make informed decisions regarding the remaining life of pressure systems and pipelines. In this Workshops, you will learn about advances in corrosion monitoring technologies. We will highlight how these new technologies can help provide the most effective data to manage and mitigate potential pressure vessels and pipelines integrity risks.",
